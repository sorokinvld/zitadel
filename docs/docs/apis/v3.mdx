The APIs described in this section are currently either in _Preview_ stage or not implemented, yet.
Before using these APIs, pleases consider the [API release policy below](#api-release-policy)

## We Appreciate your Help

We invite you to...

- ... [discuss the concept with the ZITADEL community on GitHub](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/discussions/8125).
- ... try the implementations and provide feedback [by filing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/issues/new/choose).

## The Ideas behind the New V3 APIs

The current ZITADEL _GA_ APIs are structured around contexts like System, Admin, Management, and Auth.
This structure leads to duplicate methods and makes it hard to find the right API for the right task.
Especially interacting with resources from multiple organizations is cumbersome.
Also, the APIs evolved over time, which lead to inconsistencies and a lack of flexibility in development.

We address these issues with the following new API categories:

- [Standard Resources](#standard-resources)
- [Reusable Resources](#reusable-resources)
- [Settings](#settings)

The designs for the new API categories aim for the following improvements:

### Service Structure

Instead of structuring the API methods around contexts, new APIs are structured around resources and settings.
This means, eventually, we deprecate the old System-, Admin-, Management- and AuthAPIs in favor of User-, Action-, Language-, FeatureAPIs and so on.
This change makes it easier to find the right API for the right task, especially for multi-organization resources.
Also, it allows for faster development and independent versioning of the APIs.

### Multitenancy Management and Consistency

To improve managing and reusing resources and settings in multitenancy scenarios, we define some rules for the new APIs:

- Single properties from default settings are overridable (patchable) in organizations.
- Some settings support user-defined custom properties that are also overridable in organizations.
- Improved experience with reusing resources in multiple organizations and instances.
- Resources are searchable over all organizations with a single call by default.

### HTTP and gRPC Consistency

To make the APIs more consistent and easier to use, we follow the same patterns in all Proto files.

- Patching is favored over updating resources and settings.
- HTTP calls are mapped so that query parameters can be used as much as possible. We avoid the annotation `body: "*"`.
- For search performance, we enforce query limits.

## Standard Resources

Standard resources exist in exactly one context.
For example, a user is always assigned to exactly one organization.
Or one SMS provider is always assigned to exactly one instance.

Standard resource methods behave like this:

- Search request results can be scoped to a RequestContext.
- Search request results only contain results for which the requesting user has the necessary read permissions.
- Search requests are limited to 100 by default. The limit can be increased by the caller up to 1000 by default.
- Resource configurations are partially updatable. With HTTP, this is done via PATCH requests. If no changes were made, the response is successful.
- Status changes or other actions on resources with side effects are done via POST requests. Their HTTP path ends with the underscore prefixed action name. For example `POST /resources/users/{id}/_unlock`.

For a full proto example, have a look at the [ZITADELActions service](#zitadelactions).

## Reusable Resources

Reusable resources are like standard resources but can be reused in multiple contexts.
For example, an external identity provider can be defined once on the instance.
Each organization within this instance can then choose to use this identity provider or not.

Additionally to the methods described for standard resources, reusable have the following capabilities:

Reusable resources have the same behavior as standard resources with the following additions:

- Reusable resources can be created in a given context level (system, instance, org).
- For requests, that require a resource ID, no request context is needed.
- Reusable resources are available in child contexts, even if their state is _inactive_.
- The child context can control if an inherited resource should be active or inactive for itself using a state policy.
- In child contexts, the state policy of a reused resource is _inherit_ by default and can be changed to _activate_, _deactivate_ or back to _inherit_.
- In child contexts, a reused resources configuration is read-only.
- Child contexts can read at least the following properties of reused resources:
  - ID
  - name
  - description
  - state
  - the state policy in the child context
  - sequence
  - last changed date
  - parent context
  - state in the immediate parent context.
- By default, search queries for reused resources return all resources from the given contexts, all inherited resources and all resources defined in all children contexts.

Typically, a new resource is first designed and implemented as a non-reusable resource.
If the community sees a benefit in reusing the resource in multiple contexts, reusability is added to the resource.

For a full proto example, have a look at the [ZITADELIdentityProviders service](#zitadelidentityproviders).

## Resource Services

## Settings

Settings have no identity (ID) and are always context-aware.
They also don't have a state like active or inactive.
They only have properties that can be set and queried.
These properties are inherited to from parent-contexts (instance) to child-contexts (organization).

Settings behave like this:

- Setting and retrieving settings is always context-aware. By default, the context is the instance discovered by the requests _Host_ header.
- All settings properties can be partially overridden in child-contexts.
- All settings properties can be partially reset in child-contexts, so their values default to the parent contexts property values.
- All settings properties returned by queries contain the value and if it is inherited, the context where it is inherited from.

For a full proto example, have a look at the [ZITADELLanguageSettings service](#zitadellanguagesettings).

## API Release Policy

- Defined but not yet implemented APIs are subject to change without further notice.
- Once an API definition is implemented, it is released as _Preview_ and is available for testing.
- When a _Preview_ API is tested enough so the concepts are proven to work, a new _Beta_ API is released.
- When an API is feature-complete and stable enough, a new _GA_ (General Availability) API is released.
- In all stages, changes to already implemented APIs are done in a backwards-compatible way, if possible.
- When we release a new stage for an API, we deprecate the previous stage and keep it available for a smooth transition.

## Preview APIs

These APIs are ready for testing and feedback.
Beware, they don't yet follow all the rules defined above.
