<ManagerDescription name="ManagerDescription" />

To configure managers in ZITADEL go to the resource where you like to add it (e.g Instance, Organization, Project, GrantedProject).
In the right part of the console you can finde **MANAGERS** in the details part. Here you have a list of the current managers and can add a new one.

When adding a new manager, you can select multiple roles some of which are only allowed to read data.
This can be especially useful if you add service users for one of your projects where you only need read access.

Per default you will only search for users within the selected organization. If you like to give a role to a user outside the organization you need to switch to the global search and type the exact loginname of the users. This will prevent allowing users to guess users from other organizations.

## Configure roles

If you run a self hosted ZITADEL istance you can define your custom roles by overwriting the defaults.yaml
In the InternalAuthZ section you will find all the roles and which permissions they have.

Example:
```bash
InternalAuthZ:
  RolePermissionMappings:
    - Role: "IAM_OWNER"
      Permissions:
        - "iam.read"
        - "iam.write"
```
