This annex of the [Framework Agreement](terms-of-service) describes the onboarding support services offered by us for our services.

Last revised: October 12, 2023

Our onboarding support should help you, as a new customer, to get a better understanding on how to integrate ZITADEL into your solution, how to tackle the migration, and ensure a highly-available day-to-day operation.

Onboarding support services can be offered to customers that enter a ZITADEL Cloud or a ZITADEL Enterprise subscription.

If you intend to use the open source version exclusively then please join our community chat or Github.
Your questions might help other people in the community and will make our project better over time.

Please [contact us](https://zitadel.com/contact) for a quote and to get started with onboarding support.
Below you will find topics covered and scope of the offered services.

## Proof of value

Within a short time-frame, f.e. 3 weeks, we can show the value of using our services and have the ability to establish the proof a of working setup for your most critical use cases.
We may offer to support you during an initial period to evaluate next steps.
Before the start of the period we may ask you to provide a description of your critical use cases and a high-level overview of your planned integration architecture.
During this period you should make sure that you have the necessary resources on your side to complete the proof of value.
