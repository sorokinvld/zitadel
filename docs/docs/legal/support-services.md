ZITADEL will review the case information and determine the severity level (see below), working with the customer to assess the urgency of the request and use reasonable efforts to respond to support requests within the initial response time.

ZITADEL will use reasonable efforts to resolve support request as defined below, but does not guarantee a workaround, resolution or resolution time.

When Core Services are available, the severity will be lowered to the new appropriate level.</p>
**Severity 2**<br/> Core functionality unavailable or severely degraded| <p>Core Services of ZITADEL software continue to operate in severely restricted fashion, yet long-term productivity may be impacted.</p><p> When Core Services are no longer severely degraded (eg, through a viable workaround or release), the severity level will be lowered to Severity 3.</p>
**Severity 3**<br/>Standard support request| <p>Partial and non-critical loss of ZITADEL software functionality or major software defect, yet a workaround exists for viable long-term operation.</p><p>ZITADEL will continue to work on developing permanent resolution.</p>

1. For non-urgent needs, the client may request management escalation within the ticket. A manager will review the request and provide a response within one business day.
