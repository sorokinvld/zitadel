(**"We"**, **CAOS AG**, or simply **CAOS**), with head office located at Lerchenfeldstrasse 3, 9014 St. Gallen, Switzerland, offers amongst other services and websites (**Services**) as well commercial support services (**Support Services**) for units of CAOS software products (**Unit**), if not otherwise defined a Unit refers to a is a single, dedicated setup of an application or service.

The customer relationship (**Framework Agreement** or **The Agreement**) is created by the **Customer** (**"you"**) by accepting a **Purchase Order** (**"PO"**) for the specified Support Services (**Booking**). Jointly you and CAOS will be referred to as **the Parties**. The terms of service (**"TOS"**) outlined in this document establish the most important points of this Framework Agreement â€“ independently of the use of any other services. 

This Agreement has the following appendices. When you enter the Agreement with us, you accept these agreements.

* [**Data Processing Agreement**](data-processing-agreement) - How we process personal data on behalf of you
* [**Support Service Descriptions**](support-services) - How we provide support services to you
* [**Acceptable Use Policy**](acceptable-use-policy) - What we understand as acceptable and fair use of our Services

### Alterations

Any provisions which deviate from these TOS must be agreed in writing (email sufficient) between the Customer and us. Such agreements shall take precedence over the TOS outlined in this document.

### Transfer

You may only transfer the Framework Agreement or Services used in the context of the Framework Agreement to third parties with our prior written consent.

### Term

Coverage under this Agreement will start with Booking of Support Services, for a minimum period of 12 months. Support Services agreements will automatically renew for additional one year terms upon submission of a purchase order for renewal, unless either you or CAOS provides written notice (email sufficient) of termination of any such term. Each renewal will be at CAOS' then-current rate. In the event that you accesses CAOS Support services in any way after the Agreement has expired or been terminated, you will continue to be bound by this Agreement, which will continue to apply to the services after such expiration or termination.

## Our Services

### Type and scope of the services

We provide the Services under the conditions stated on our websites and the PO at the time of booking.

### Modifications of services offered

We are entitled to offer new services, to withdraw existing services (**Termination**) or to modify the specifications and prices of existing services (**Modification**) at any time. If the modification or termination affects a service that you are using at that time, we will inform you via email that said service will be automatically modified and/or is no longer available after a period of 30 days.

If such modification would have a disadvantageous impact on the Customer use of service, CAOS and Customer must discuss the change with the Customer first and, to the best of its ability, find a solution that is acceptable to both Parties. If such a solution cannot be found, CAOS may implement the modification and Customer may submit notice of termination of the relevant Service (email is sufficient) before the modification becomes effective without being obliged to pay contractual penalties or termination fees. CAOS may modify the prices for a service after the minimum term of the agreement.

### Modification of services booked by you

You may change or terminate Services booked by you at any time. Modifications will take effect in the next billing period, or as agreed otherwise between the Parties. Changing services booked by you requires a new PO, stating the new conditions of the services after Modification, to be accepted by the Parties.

### Due care

We take all appropriate physical and electronic precautions to ensure the security and availability of our infrastructure and the service offered thereupon, in particular to protect against unauthorized access to data, data loss, failures and misuse.

The [Annex of the data processing agreement](data-processing-agreement#annex-regarding-security-measures) outlines the measures we take in more detail.

### Support Service

The Description of Support Services is available as [Annex](support-services) to this document.

The parties may enter a service level agreement, as specified in our [Support Service Description](support-services), for booked Support Services. Only named persons in the Purchase Order, or as agreed in writing (email is sufficient) may use the Support Services to interact with CAOS.

### Service credit

Failure to provide the agreed service level objectives during the term of the Agreement results in compensation via service credits, as outlined in the [Annex](support-services) per service level objective.

Customer must request service credit and must notify CAOS in writing (email sufficient) within 30 days of becoming eligible for service credit and must prove failure of CAOS to meet the stated objective. CAOS will confirm or reject the claim with reasons for a refusal within 10 days. Service credit will in no case be paid as a cash equivalent. No further guarantees are provided.

### Service review

If not otherwise agreed, CAOS offers a yearly review meeting with you to discuss the service quality and any feedback you might have. We are not required to participate in the meeting after the term has expired.

### Limited influence

Be advised that the scope of our influence is limited. For example, the actual accessibility of a service is also dependent on the connection to and between various Internet Service Providers ("ISPs"). Portions of our services, i.e. software components, may also be beyond our influence and be subject to their own contractual conditions. You accept that in such cases we reject any responsibility.

### Inclusion of third parties

We may include third parties in the provision of our services. See our [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy) and our [Data Processing Agreement](data-processing-agreement) for more information.

Recertification of a unit, to be covered under Support Services, is required for:

* units for which Support Services have been expired for more than 180 days
* units that run a release that is older than 180 days from the products most recent stable release
