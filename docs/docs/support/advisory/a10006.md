title: Technical Advisory 10006
---

## Date and Version

Version: 2.39.0

Date: Calendar week 41/42 2023

## Description

Versions >= 2.39.0 require the cockroach database user of ZITADEL to be granted to the `VIEWACTIVITY` grant. This can either be reached by grant the role manually or execute the `zitadel init` command.

## Statement

To query correct order of events the cockroach database user of ZITADEL needs additional privileges to query the `crdb_internal.cluster_transactions`-table

## Mitigation

Before migrating to versions >= 2.39.0 make sure the cockroach database user has sufficient grants.

## Impact

If the user doesn't have sufficient grants, events won't be updated.
