title: Technical Advisory 10009
---

## Date and Version

Version: 2.53.0

Date: 2024-05-28

## Description

There were rare cases where Cockroachdb got blocked during runtime of ZITADEL and returned `WRITE_TOO_OLD`-errors to ZITADEL. The root cause of the problem is described in [this github issue of the database](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/77119). The workaround provided by the database is enabling the `enable_durable_locking_for_serializable`-flag as described [here](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/75456#issuecomment-1936277716).

Because enabling flags requires admin privileges the statement must be executed manually or by executing `zitadel init` command.

## Statement

Ensure lock distribution for `FOR UPDATE`-statements on Cockroachdb.

## Mitigation

Cockroachdb version >= 23.2.

## Impact

Adding additional raft queries to `FOR UPDATE`-statements can impact performance slightly but ensures availability of the system.
