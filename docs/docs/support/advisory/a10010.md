## Date and Version

Version: 2.53.0

Date: 2024-05-28

## Description

Version 2.53.0 optimizes the way tokens are created and migrates them to the v2 implementation already used by OAuth / OIDC tokens created through the session API.

Because of this tokens events are no longer created on the user itself. To be as backwards compatible as possible a separate event is created on the user for the audit log.

## Statement

This change was tracked in the following PR:
[perf(oidc): optimize token creation](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/pull/7822), which was released in Version [2.53.0](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.53.0)

## Mitigation

If you use the ListEvents API to check the audit trail of a user or being able to compute Daily or Monthly Active Users, be sure to also include the `user.token.v2.added` event type in your search
if you already query for the `user.token.added` event type.

## Impact

Once this update has been released and deployed, the `user.token.added` event will no longer be created when a user access token is created, but instead a `user.token.v2.added`.
Existing `user.token.added` events will be untouched.
