title: Technical Advisory
---

Technical advisories are notices that report major issues with ZITADEL Self-Hosted or the ZITADEL Cloud platform that could potentially impact security or stability in production environments. 
These advisories may include details about the nature of the issue, its potential impact, and recommended mitigation actions.

Users are strongly encouraged to evaluate these advisories and consider the recommended mitigation actions independently from their version upgrade schedule. 
We understand that these advisories may include breaking changes, and we aim to provide clear guidance on how to address these changes.

### Breaking Behaviour Change

A breaking behavior change refers to a modification or update that changes the behavior of ZITADEL.
This change does not necessarily affect the APIs or any functions you are calling, so it may not require an update to your code.
However, if you rely on specific results or behaviors, they may no longer be guaranteed after the change is implemented.
Therefore, it is important to be aware of breaking behavior changes and their potential impact on your use of ZITADEL, and to take appropriate action if needed to ensure continued functionality.
